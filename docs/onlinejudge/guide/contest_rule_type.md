# Competition mode

Version 2.0 supports two competition modes, which can be flexibly selected according to needs:

+ ACM mode

    In this mode, we strictly follow the ACM-ICPC competition rules. The `real time rank` in the Contest setting is whether to close the list. After the list is closed, the ranking will not be refreshed.

+ OI mode

    In the OI mode, players' submissions will be scored based on the points scored. For multiple submissions, the last submission shall prevail. The ranking rule is the total score of multiple questions.

    In order to take care of the various rules of the OI mode, and because there is no such thing as a list in the OI mode, we give a special meaning to the `real time rank` in the OI mode:

    When the `real time rank` is turned on, players can see the results of the judgment immediately after submission, and can view Rankings, Submissions and other information (similar to ACM, but scored by points),
    When `real time rank` is turned off, contest participants will not be able to get the results after submission, and they will not be able to view the results until the end of the contest.

It should be noted that the super administrator and the creator of the game have the ownership of the game, that is, they are not subject to any of the above restrictions, and the results of the test samples can be viewed in any mode, and they can also be forced by `Force Update` when the list is closed Refresh the list, and the refreshed list is only visible to managers
