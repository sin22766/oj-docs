# User rights

There are currently three types of permissions in OJ:

+ Super administrator
+ Ordinary administrator
+ Ordinary user

## Super Administrator

The super administrator has complete control over the entire system and is the highest authority in the OJ system. The super administrator can view all competitions and questions, and can change the system settings. The following settings are only visible to the super administrator:

Among them, the `Problem Permission` item is set for ordinary administrators to manage those problems:

+ `None`: No permission management problem
+ `Own`: Can only manage questions created by yourself
+ `All`: can manage all questions

You can choose according to your needs and assign permissions flexibly

## Ordinary Administrator

As mentioned above, the authority of ordinary administrators is related to the settings of super administrators. In addition, for the game, the owner of the game is the super administrator and the creator of the game, which means that only these two roles can manage the game

## general user

Ordinary OJ users cannot log in to the background management page, they are the users with the lowest OJ authority.
